1. `console.log(i)` will print the last value of `i` after the `for` statement has finished executing and since the condition states `i < prices.length`, the last value of `i` will be equal to `prices.length` which will be 3 here as prices is assigned to [100, 200, 300] which has length 3.
2. This line will display the last value assigned to the variable `discountedPrice` which will be `prices[2] * (1 - 0.5)` which is 300 * 0.5 = 150.
3. This line displays the last value assigned to `finalPrice`. The rounded value of 150 * 100 is 15000 and 15000 / 100 is 150.
